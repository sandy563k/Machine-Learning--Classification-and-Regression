# Machine-Learning--Classification-and-Regression
We have been given two data sets “sample.pickle” and “diabetes.pickle”. We used various Classification and Regression techniques as follows and analysed the results:
1.Experiment with Gaussian Discriminators
  (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis)
2.Experiment with Linear Regression
  (Linear Regression without Intercept
  ,Linear Regression with Intercept)
3.Ridge Regression 
4.Gradient Descent for Ridge Regression 
5. Non-linear Regression
